# Ripserer.jl

_Efficient computation of persistent homology._

A Julia reimplementation of the [ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser) algorithm for
persistent homology. This package is not a direct translation and might do or name some
things differently.

Ripserer's performance is generally around 2 times slower than
[ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser), but in some cases, it performs just as well or
even better.
